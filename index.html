            APROR was a team of five friends: Abhishek, Prateek, Rehan, Omer, and Rohit, who came together out of sheer curiosity and ambition. 
                We weren’t bound by roles; we just took up whatever needed to be done and pulled fullnighters to figure things out. Our weekends were filled with hackathons, long whiteboard sessions, and lots of chai-fueled debates. 
                Whether we were prototyping or pitching, it always felt like we were building something that mattered. 
                We participated in numerous college and external hackathons and ended up winning multiple prizes, certificates, and wild applause along the way. 
                SfUIT was our first real project, the one that made it feel like this could become something bigger.

            <p class="casual">
            Speed Limit Assistant was a three-member group project we built during our undergrad, aimed at helping drivers stay within speed limits. 
                The app would turn red and alert the user if they were going faster than allowed on the current street.
                We used real-time GPS data to track location and pulled street-wise speed limits using HereMap APIs. 
                It was one of those classic "simple but smart" ideas: practical, intuitive, and kind of thrilling to build. 
                I primarily handled the logic and backend work, but we all pitched in across the board, from frontend tweaks to prepping for the final demo.

            <p class="technical">
            Speed Limit Assistant was a mobile application developed in Android Studio to promote safer driving habits through real-time speed monitoring. 
                The app utilized the device’s <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="GPS">GPS</a> to detect the user's current location, and the <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="HereMap API">HereMap API</a> 
                to fetch the legal speed limit for that specific street. It then compared that limit against the user's actual speed, calculated via the phone’s accelerometer and location data. 
                I was responsible for implementing the backend logic, handling sensor input, API calls, and trigger conditions and contributed to the UI integration logic as well. 
                The app included a live map view and visual alert system that turned the screen red when the driver exceeded the limit.

                We poured everything into it, from sensor logic and app development to editing pitch videos at 2AM. 
                It all paid off at the Assistive Technology Summit, where we showcased it in front of prominent figures from the Telangana Government.  
                Winning 2nd prize and a ₹150,000 award felt surreal, not just for the money, but for the validation that we could actually build something that mattered.

                caretakers, or doctors to monitor vitals in real time. The system also had a built-in emergency trigger that alerted caretakers and pinged emergency services with the user’s live location. 
                I contributed across the stack, from ensuring sensor accuracy to backend integrations, pitch decks, and demo preparations. It was a complete all-hands-on-deck sprint, and our first taste of building end-to-end, human-centric tech.
