            I pursued my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from Matrusri Engineering College under Osmania University. 
                It was during these four years that I began discovering what I was truly interested in: coding, building useful things, and exploring how technology fits into daily life. 
                I was actively involved in Matrusri Campus Connect (MCC), our student chapter, where we hosted everything from Holi and Diwali events to tech fests and speaker series. 
                In my final year, I took up the role of Social Media Handler, designing promotions and managing community buzz for all our events.

            <p>
            APROR was a team of five friends — Abhishek, Prateek, Rehan, Omer, and Rohit — who came together out of sheer curiosity and ambition. 
                We weren’t bound by roles; we just took up whatever needed to be done and pulled fullnighters to figure things out. Our weekends were filled with hackathons, long whiteboard sessions, and lots of chai-fueled debates. 
                Whether we were prototyping or pitching, it always felt like we were building something that mattered. 
                We participated in numerous college and external hackathons and ended up winning multiple prizes, certificates, and wild applause along the way. 
                SfUIT was our first real project, the one that made it feel like this could become something bigger.

            <!-- Technical Paragraph -->
            <p>
            As part of APROR, I primarily handled backend and logic-heavy tasks while also supporting others across the stack. We built multiple hackathon-ready projects using

            <!-- Casual Paragraph -->
            <p>
            Speed Limit Assistant was a three-member group project we built during our undergrad, aimed at helping drivers stay within speed limits. 
                The app would turn red and alert the user if they were going faster than allowed on the current street.
                We used real-time GPS data to track location and pulled street-wise speed limits using HereMap APIs. 
                It was one of those classic "simple but smart" ideas: practical, intuitive, and kind of thrilling to build. 
                I primarily handled the logic and backend work, but we all pitched in across the board — from frontend tweaks to prepping for the final demo.
            </p>
            <!-- Technical Paragraph -->
            <p>
            Speed Limit Assistant was a mobile application developed in Android Studio to promote safer driving habits through real-time speed monitoring. 
                The app utilized the device’s <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="GPS">GPS</a> to detect the user's current location, and the <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="HereMap API">HereMap API</a> 
                to fetch the legal speed limit for that specific street. It then compared that limit against the user's actual speed, calculated via the phone’s accelerometer and location data. 
                I was responsible for implementing the backend logic, handling sensor input, API calls, and trigger conditions — and contributed to the UI integration logic as well. 
                The app included a live map view and visual alert system that turned the screen red when the driver exceeded the limit.

            SfUIT (pronounced “Suit”) was our first recognized project under APROR, and our proudest one. 
                It was a smart wearable designed to monitor health vitals and assist users during emergencies. 
                We poured everything into it, from sensor logic and app development to editing pitch videos at 2AM. 
                It all paid off at the Assistive Technology Summit, where we showcased it in front of prominent figures from the Telangana Government.  
                Winning 2nd prize and a ₹150,000 award felt surreal, not just for the money, but for the validation that we could actually build something that mattered.

                caretakers, or doctors to monitor vitals in real time. The system also had a built-in emergency trigger that alerted caretakers and pinged emergency services with the user’s live location. 
                I contributed across the stack, from ensuring sensor accuracy to backend integrations, pitch decks, and demo preparations. It was a complete all-hands-on-deck sprint, and our first taste of building end-to-end, human-centric tech.

                We used the example of medical data, patient vitals, in this case, to demonstrate the concept. Our three-person group followed the same dynamic as before: 
                I worked on the logic and backend, while the others handled frontend and presentation. It was a challenging yet satisfying experience to apply cryptographic theory in a real-world use case and actually see it working.

                The project included a basic UI for input/output demonstration, but my primary contributions were focused on the backend logic for encryption, data transfer protocols, and ensuring accurate key computation. 
                The system allowed encrypted exchange of patient vitals between two simulated endpoints, ensuring that the actual data remained unreadable without access to the negotiated secret key. 
                This project strengthened my understanding of secure communication protocols and gave me hands-on experience with privacy-focused system design.

            In this student-facing administrative role, I handled high-frequency requests from continuing education students, including course registration, payment deferral enrollment, course drops, transfers, and refund workflows 
                via email and phone. I worked extensively with <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Outlook">Outlook</a>, <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Excel">Excel</a>, <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Slate">Slate</a>, 
                and <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Perceptive Content">Perceptive Content (ImageNow)</a> for workflow tracking, record management, and form processing. I also contributed heavily to PDF editing and internal content 
                creation using <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Adobe">Adobe</a>, often managing document formatting, batch updates, and instructional materials. Due to my reliability, I was entrusted with side projects like office 
                maintenance coordination, instructor data collation, and scheduling updates. I was considered reliable to train new hires when other team members were unavailable, even after transitioning to my next role.

            <h3>School of Continuing and Professional Studies | April 2025 - Present | Chicago, IL, USA</h3>
            <!-- Casual Paragraph -->
            <p>
            After a year as a Department Assistant, I transitioned into a more focused role as a Program Assistant, working directly under a Program Manager in the same department. 
                While the office stayed the same, the nature of the work shifted: I now deal with course-specific tasks, assist in managing programs, and handle instructor and student support on a more academic level. 
                I continue to be someone the office relies on, but now it’s more about diving deeper into the rhythms of course planning, keeping an eye on enrollments, and stepping in when students or instructors need help. 
                It’s quieter work in some ways, but also more structured, and I’m enjoying that shift.

            <p>
            As a Program Assistant, I provide academic and administrative support to a Program Manager overseeing several continuing education programs at DePaul. My daily responsibilities include monitoring course enrollment data, 
                managing student queries via <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Outlook">Outlook</a> and phone, and assisting with course planning and logistics on behalf of the Program Manager when they are unavailable. 
                I work extensively with <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Excel">Excel</a>, <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Slate">Slate</a>, and <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="D2L">D2L</a> with access to 
                program files and databases that I previously didn’t interact with. This role is more autonomous and course-administration focused than my prior one, requiring attention to detail, discretion, and a strong sense 
                of ownership over program workflows and communications.
