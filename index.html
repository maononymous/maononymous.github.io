            <h2>Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Computer Science and Engineering</h2>
            <h3>Osmania University | GPA: 7.43/10 | August 2018 - May 2022 | Hyderabad, India</h3>
            <!-- Casual Paragraph -->
            <p>
            I pursued my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from Matrusri Engineering College under Osmania University. 
                It was during these four years that I began discovering what I was truly interested in: coding, building useful things, and exploring how technology fits into daily life. 
                I was actively involved in Matrusri Campus Connect (MCC), our student chapter, where we hosted everything from Holi and Diwali events to tech fests and speaker series. 
                In my final year, I took up the role of Social Media Handler, designing promotions and managing community buzz for all our events.

            <h2>GATE - General Aptitude Test in Engineering</h2>
            <h3>All India Rank: 200 | GATE 2023 | India</h3>
            <!-- Casual Paragraph -->
            <p>
            I appeared for GATE 2023 (CSE) and secured an All India Rank of 200 — out of over 100,000 candidates — in my very first attempt. 
                I gave it my all for 8 months, showing up every day with focus, discipline, and the occasional plate of biryani as fuel. 
                The preparation phase tested more than just technical skills, it taught me how to pace myself, stay consistent, and deal with uncertainty. 
                When the results dropped, it was one of those rare moments that just hit different: loud, quiet, proud, all at once.
            </p>
            <!-- Technical Paragraph -->
            <p>
              I took a full-syllabus approach to GATE preparation, ensuring each subject got the depth and practice it deserved. 
                While <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Engineering Mathematics">Engineering Mathematics</a> and <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="General Aptitude">General Aptitude</a> were my natural strengths, 
                I devoted focused effort to subjects like <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Operating Systems">Operating Systems</a>, 
                <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Computer Organization & Architecture">Computer Organization & Architecture</a>, and 
                <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Computer Networks">Computer Networks</a>, which required more revision and layered understanding. 
                I also covered topics like <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Algorithms">Algorithms</a>, <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Data Structures">Data Structures</a>, 
                <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Theory of Computation">Theory of Computation</a>, <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Databases">Databases</a>, 
                and <a href="#!" class="skill" data-skill="Compiler Design">Compiler Design</a> with equal seriousness, ensuring I was confident across the board. 
                Regular mock tests, performance analysis, and timed practice sessions helped me build precision, resilience, and a sense of exam rhythm.

            <!-- Casual Paragraph -->
            <p>
            DePaul’s been nothing short of transformative for me. I came in open-minded and found my creative anchor through the iOS Development courses I took across two quarters. 
                They pushed me to build more, express more, and actually enjoy the process of coding — beyond just solving problems. 
                The city itself feels like the U.S. version of Hyderabad — vibrant, welcoming, and full of character. 
                I love cycling along the Lakefront Trail to campus and work, and the gym and rec center have become part of my rhythm here. 
                I’ve also had the opportunity to serve as a student assistant at the university, which has added a whole new layer to my experience.

                The student involvement events on campus are always buzzing with energy — I try to attend as many as I can. 
                I've found new friends here in Chicago and reconnected with old ones too, which has made the experience all the more meaningful. 
                I’ve also had the opportunity to serve as a student assistant at the university, which has added a whole new layer to my experience.
